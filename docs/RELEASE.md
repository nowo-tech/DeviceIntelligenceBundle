## Pre-release

Run the full release pipeline:

```bash
make release-check
```

Expected steps:

- Asset build (`pnpm run build`)
- Composer validation and lock sync
- Code style checks
- Static analysis (Rector dry run + PHPStan)
- PHP and TypeScript test suites with coverage
- Demo verification (`demo/Makefile` `release-check`)

## Security checklist (12.4.1)

Before tagging, confirm each item in [SECURITY.md — Release security checklist](SECURITY.md#release-security-checklist-1241). Note confirmation in the release PR or tag message.

## GitHub About (REQ-DOCS-018)

GitHub repository **About** is not stored in git. Copy the values from [GITHUB.md](GITHUB.md). After creating or transferring `nowo-tech/DeviceIntelligenceBundle`, set:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | Symfony Device Intelligence: probabilistic matching, risk scoring, collect endpoint. Device IDs are not credentials. |
| **Website** | https://nowo.tech |
| **Topics** | `symfony`, `symfony-bundle`, `php`, `device-intelligence`, `antifraud`, `frankenphp`, `nowo` |

## Tag and publish

1. Move `[Unreleased]` entries in `docs/CHANGELOG.md` to a new `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section.
2. Update `docs/UPGRADING.md` if consumers must change code or configuration.
3. Create an **annotated** tag: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"`.
4. Push the tag: `git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
5. Confirm GitHub workflows `release.yml` and `sync-releases.yml` completed successfully.

## Post-release checks

- Verify Packagist metadata is updated.
- Confirm the GitHub release contains the tag message and changelog section.
- Validate installation in a clean Symfony app:

```bash
composer require nowo-tech/device-intelligence-bundle
```

- Smoke-test `POST /_device/collect` and the demo home page.

## Coverage goals

- **PHP**: **≥99%** line coverage (prefer **100%**; `make test-coverage`)
- **TypeScript**: **≥90%** line coverage (`make test-ts`)

Update README **Tests and coverage** percentages after each release when coverage changes materially.

## Release history

| Version | Date | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [1.0.0](CHANGELOG.md#100---2026-08-23) | 2026-08-23 | First stable release: matching, collect, Doctrine, profiler, Vite collectors, FrankenPHP demo |
